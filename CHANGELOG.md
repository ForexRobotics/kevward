# Changelog

## 0.2.2

- **Documented the AI-assisted workflow.** The README now shows how to turn a
  `--json` report into a prioritized remediation plan with an LLM, and frames
  the project as *human-directed, AI-built*. CONTRIBUTING adds
  AI-assisted contribution prompts for adding a service plugin, a new distro
  backend, and version-level KEV matching. No code changes.

## 0.2.1

- **Fixed the install instructions.** `pip install .` fails on Ubuntu 24.04 /
  Debian with `externally-managed-environment` (PEP 668). The README now leads
  with `pipx install kevward`, documents the system-wide venv install for
  `sudo kevward`, and shows the from-source dev install inside a venv.
- Added a screenshot of the HTML report to the README (`docs/img/`).

## 0.2.0

- **Renamed the project from `patchward` to `kevward`** ahead of its first PyPI
  release (the name `patchward` was already taken on PyPI by an unrelated
  project). The command, Python package, config paths (`/etc/kevward`,
  `/var/log/kevward`, `/var/cache/kevward`) and systemd units
  (`kevward-report.*`, `kevward-apply.*`) are all renamed. Existing
  installations should reinstall under the new name.
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow to publish to PyPI via Trusted Publishing on
  tagged releases.

## 0.1.3

- **Python 3.10 support** (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS). The 3.11-only `StrEnum`,
  `tomllib` and `datetime.UTC` are replaced with 3.10-compatible equivalents;
  `tomli` is pulled in automatically on 3.10 only. Tested on 3.10–3.13.
- **New service plugins**: Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and
  Redis — apt-managed, with CISA KEV term mapping. Apache also gets a
  ServerTokens hardening check.
- README: documented supported services, the Python requirement and the
  virtualenv/system-path install.

## 0.1.2

- **KEV matching no longer uses the free-text vulnerability name**, only the
  vendor and product. A CVE whose description happens to mention a technology
  (e.g. a Zimbra or Juniper advisory with "PHP" in its name) no longer
  false-matches a host that merely runs that technology.

## 0.1.1

- **KEV trends scoped to detected software.** CISA KEV matching now uses the
  products actually present on the host (via each plugin's `kev_terms`) instead
  of a broad built-in keyword list, so results no longer include appliances and
  products the host doesn't run (Fortinet, Cisco, Citrix, VMware, ...).
- Plugins gained an optional `kev_terms` attribute; `plugin.detected_kev_terms()`
  collects terms for present services.
- `trends` output and the HTML report now state that matches are name-level and
  that version applicability must be confirmed per CVE.

## 0.1.0

- Initial public release.
